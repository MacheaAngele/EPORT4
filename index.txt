My favorite colors would be neutral colors, specifically white and black. I love arts, photography, music, reading books, and watching movies (plus crime documentaries hehe). I have a lot of favorite music artists !! However, if I were to pick my top 5, they would be Enhypen, Cup of Joe, NIKI, Wave to Earth, and One Direction.

                                <p> For this quarter, it wasn't easy. As a person who is not good at coding in general, I did quite have a difficult time understanding the lesson. However, practicing codes in the ICT room was fun and helped me differentiate the codes based on their appearance and purpose. Coding really isn't for the weak, that I can say hehe. But through the group studies and panics I've had, I am sure that this quarter is full of memories. Now that it is the final quarter, I want to say thank you to our wonderful ICT teacher, Ms. Uminga for making the discussions more fun! Coding isn't easy, until now I still do not find it easy, but it was surely enjoyable experiencing coding with the whole class. I will miss you, Ms. Uminga, the whole class will too!  </p>
